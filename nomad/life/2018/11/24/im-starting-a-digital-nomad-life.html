<p>4 years ago I started to dedicate my life, with 2 friends, to build one I idea we had once: make people travel in a different way across Europe. This is how Waynabox started. These 4 years have been awesome; full of emotions, knowing new people and learning more than an after-university grade could teach me, but I’ve been too focused on doing everything works smoothly that I’ve not had time to do what I enjoy the most: <strong>travel</strong>.</p>

<p>Travel is one of the best things you can do in life. They say travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer. And it’s true. You are buying an experience and, as human behavior is defined by experiences, after all, it defines who you are. There is nothing like seeing other cultures, know how do the people live in the other part of the globe, discover traditions that never could imagine o connect with someone at a glance that you have never seen before. Travel changes your perception about what you have, who you are and what do you want.</p>

<em>Myself visiting Split, one of the most beautiful cities in Croatia</em></p>

<p>Last November 16 I turned 27, and with the 30s crisis approaching (yeah, you now will say I’m still young and so on) you start asking yourself some things. What I just did achieve? Did I miss something? How much time I have before I take a house loan?</p>

<p>So I think it’s a good moment to stop and think about what is what I want and which things are those ones which make me happy. And one of them is travel. Is true I’ve traveled a lot lastly through Europe, but I’ve never known what does it feels like being on vacations more than 2 days in a row and disconnect from your work entirely, something I suppose it’s important to do from time to time. Knowing that Waynabox is still running good -and hopefully it will do in the near future, I think a good solution is to work traveling. Good to me, being developer allows you to work from anywhere where you have internet and coffee to convert into code, so I started to interest in this style of life, and I saw there are a lot of freelancers/developers that do that.</p>

<p>I decided to left the flat where I live, sell my motorbike and start a digital nomad life.</p>

<p>I know it’s not a lifestyle for everyone, but now I’m not chained to any loan and still single, is a good time to give it a try.</p>

<p>To not be disconnected entirely from my work team, I’ve decided to do travel cycles, like 2-3 months traveling and one in my birthplace (Barcelona) to don’t lose the contact with my family and friends. This way I’ll still be able to discover the world without and keep time for being with the people I love.</p>

<h3 id="where-do-i-start-from">Where do I start from?</h3>
<p>The same way you usually do an MVP when you are trying to launch an idea, I’m making a pilot journey to Lisbon, where I’ll be working from 2 weeks to establish some protocols, try remote working tools and adapt myself to this new lifestyle. Why Lisbon? Well, is one of my favorite city in Europe. The food is amazing, it’s cheap and I have some friends there. There is no better way to start this adventure!</p>

<p>The nice thing about being a digital nomad is that you are free to go wherever you want and decide where are you going to live your life in your next months it’s not easy. Nomadlist helped me a lot to decide but I’ve always wanted to visit two regions: South America and Asia.</p>

<p>As recently new low-cost airlines appeared to do long-haul trips, the price tickets for going to America are really cheap now, so I’ve decided to start from visiting Mexico (I like spicy food and my surname is Mendoza, you know) and also visit some other US cities in the way.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/route.png" alt="How my route looks like so far" title="How my route looks like so far" class="img-responsive" />
 <em>How my route looks like so far</em></p>

<p>For all of those who are thinking about taking this lifestyle or just want to know about how my adventure is going I’ve opened this blog (I hope I can keep updated, I’m not really used to write too much about my life) where I’ll be posting my trips, pictures, experiences, and tips about the places I visit.</p>

<p>This is all for now. I’m really excited about to start this adventure. I’m conscious I’ll know a lot of new people, I’ll discover new cultures and I’ll life new unique experiences. But life is about that. Isn’t it?</p>

<p>Keep talking</p>
