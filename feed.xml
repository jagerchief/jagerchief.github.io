When Google Stadia was announced, I was one of the first people to buy the founder’s pack because the idea of being able to play on any screen anywhere, just by having an internet connection and a controller, was perfectly matching my plans to play while I was traveling around the world. Since the first packs began to arrive, I’ve been seeing on the internet a lot of hate and many reviews that did not put this service in a good place and I thought it was because they introduced only the beta version. I decided to do my personal review of a daily user so you can get an idea of what you will get if you decide to make the leap to this platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s discuss the most important features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Latency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big worry. You´ve probably heard the phrase “sure, you need a very good connection and very low ping to be able to play” as it is a streaming-based service. Well, I play mainly in my house located near Barcelona, where the fiber doesn’t reach. Connected to Ethernet, I get 23Mb/s and 20Mb/s over wifi. With this connection, I can play Stadia without any problem. The character responds quickly, the camera movements are fluid and even Stadia says that my connection is excellent for playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/stadia-gif.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Myself visiting Split, one of the most beautiful cities in Croatia&quot; title=&quot;Myself visiting Split, one of the most beautiful cities in Croatia&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Myself visiting Split, one of the most beautiful cities in Croatia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if the video comes in 1080 or 4K (as my TV is only 1080), but it looks super sharp. There’s no difference between playing using Stadia or a traditional console. Only sometimes, when I play from my MacBook Pro via Wi-Fi while in bed, there are moments when the video stream appears lag occasional. I’ve also tried playing in my office, where we have 300Mb/s and obviously everything works perfectly. So, I can say that you don’t need a super-fast connection to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, using Stadia feels really good. Buying a game is intuitive and quick and the menus of both the app and the screen are self-explanatory. The controller is very comfortable, I’ve spent more than 2 hours playing (and my chromecast didn’t explode as some users have reported). However, the configuration of the buttons on the controller makes you inadvertently press the screen capture button almost every time you want to open the options menu. There are many items that are not yet available, such as activating the Google assistant from the remote, making groups of friends or being able to give the buddy pass. That’s why the whole experience isn’t complete yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure who Stadia is aimed at: PC users will hardly be able to switch to controller and it doesn’t make any sense for those already having a console to switch to Stadia. I imagine it will be useful in those cases, in which you want to make the leap to buy a new console and consider this alternative. Apart from that, if more games are added in the future (which I’m sure about), it’s overall a good service that delivers what it promises. I guess. we’ll see the level of acceptance it has in the gaming world over the next year&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dani</name></author><category term="lifestyle" /><summary type="html">This was supposed to be a tweet, but as it got a bit too long, I’ll put it into a post.

As a good hacker, I took a look at it and to my surprise I saw that it was organized by Kiwi (a company I know and admire for using their website almost every time I plan a trip) and I was also passionate about the challenge: to improve the travel industry by creating a tool using their API. It was perfect. I come from the world of travel, I like programming and I like the challenges could not be more aligned with the event.
I had been thinking about an idea for a long time and this event was perfect to carry it out. It was a tool for those couples who live at a distance. The idea was that users enter two origins and the system looked for the cheapest destination to be based on the price of flights.
Besides, luckily for me, Kiwi has an API that allows you to tell it an origin and shows you (sorted by price) the flights to any part of the world. So you just had to match the list of flights between two origins and ready.
So I needed some frontend or backend to help me do it in 24 hours, so I started asking my friends if they would join. After a few days we already had equipment. Marc, a front-end Vue specialist from Verse, Fernando, UX/UI master who works with me and me. We were very excited a few days before to talk about what features I could have, in which frameworks we felt more comfortable and as we were going to explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just some days before the event I receive an email saying something like:
“We are sorry to inform you that you were not selected to participate in this first edition”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our faces were like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/wtf-image.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Our faces were: what the fuck?&quot; title=&quot;Our what-the-fuck faces&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? We are the perfect developers for this hackathon!
Would it be for lack of places? Is it because I don’t have any code uploaded to my GitHub account?
I was really disappointed and before surrendering I tweet this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/tweet-hackathon.png&quot; alt=&quot;Myself visiting Split, one of the most beautiful cities in Croatia&quot; title=&quot;Myself visiting Split, one of the most beautiful cities in Croatia&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost unexpectedly, I received a reply from Kiwi in the form of an email in my inbox:
“We would love for you to join. Please provide more info.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, when I submitted the request via the web, I hardly sent any information about who we were and what we had done in the software world, so we explained where we worked, who we were, sent our LinkedIn profiles and picked up a team name: Hacking Airlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ready to hack!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day of the event arrived. We were very nervous. Especially Fer, who was his first hackathon.
The place was fantastic (Aticco Barcelona): there was a lot of food and drink, rooms with monitors and even they bought inflatable mattresses. After dinner and after the 11 teams presented their idea, it was time to get to work. It seemed like there was a lot of level. Even 2 teams had the same idea as us! So we could only beat them if we ran it better than them. Pressure from minute 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After designing the main features and drawing how the UX would be we started developing. I decided to do the backend in Flask because it had been a while since I coded Python while Marc did the frontend in Vue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Kiwi we were told that they had some components ready to work with so that would speed up the development. Even they were made in React  (being a NPM package) we thought it would not be difficult to put them in Vue, so we tried. The hours passed and when we finally make the components work in Vue, we see that it is impossible to pass properties and make them work. Holy molly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should we do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was 5 o’clock in the morning and we had been invested many hours to get back. If we continued with Vue we had to do it without the help of the Kiwi components. It was a tough decision. We risked it? Neither Marc nor I had any idea about React. In the end we thought we’d come here to learn and have fun, so we did a git reset –hard, had a few shots of tequila and started all over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point we were happy to do 1 or 2 screens and show, even if it was mock, the idea we had. A few hours later I had the backend ready and our mentor Jan helped Marc connect to it.
We even had a chance to make a working demo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was almost time to finish and, after eating a great paella on the terrace, we started to prepare the presentation. Those were the most stressful moments of the whole weekend. While Marc was making the search button work, I was buying the domain, uploading the web to the server and making it work (thank you Docker).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the teams presented their project and what they had achieved. It was amazing to see what people are able to do in 24 hours. I remember that a group presented a platform to find other travelers who had a stopover at your same airport. At that moment I told my colleagues: this project is going to win.
I remember telling him the same thing in the following: a gamification app for when you get bored at the airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the projects were incredible and we presented ours the penultimate ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of us were very tired, as we had more than 24 without sleep (some of us got 1 hour or 2 on the mattresses) so I tried to make the presentation more fun and decided to explain our story of how we went from 0 to hero in React that night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went from absolute tension to absolute relax. We went upstairs to the terrace with a few beers, background music and discussed with the other groups how it had gone, how they were and how they had seen the event.
15 minutes later the jury went up to give the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the winner is…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They started giving the prize to the best design, third place, second place and finally to the winners.
It was Juraj Hrinik, Kiwi’s product owner, who announced it saying something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For having learned a language in less than 24 hours and having built something fantastic with it, the winners are Hacking Airlines”.
We couldn’t believe it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.giphy.com/media/4cLdFBtkgDV8A/giphy.gif&quot; alt=&quot;How my route looks like so far&quot; title=&quot;How my route looks like so far&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went up to collect the prize (1000€ in kiwi vouchers) and thanked everyone for making it possible.
Then, still in shock, we stayed a while longer talking with the Kiwi team and the rest of the participants. We even improvised a karaoke while they were serving Margaritas!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/kiwi-hackathon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Myself visiting Split, one of the most beautiful cities in Croatia&quot; title=&quot;Myself visiting Split, one of the most beautiful cities in Croatia&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I learned&lt;/strong&gt;
The fact is, even though we were rejected in the beginning, we ended up winning. This is an example of the things that happen to you (and will happen) in real life. You may not get selected in a job or fail your driving test or there may be people who tell you not to do what you’re thinking, but the important thing is not to stop fighting. When you really have a goal and a lot of desire, you are unstoppable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, and as the Stackoverflow surveys says, hackathons serve to learn and build community. In our case, we met many people, many cracks eager to learn and face new challenges and many stories of people I admire since then (such as a group of UX students who had never programmed and who ended up in second place or an architect who left everything at the third of career to start learning programming) and all of us in greater or lesser degree ended up learning something new and leaving our comfort zone.
In all cases they are people who discover a passion and pursue it no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was such a great experience, after all, and we are very proud to say we will finish our project in the next weeks with all the main features finished 🙂

Full of trips, adventures, new emotions and surprising experiences. I’ve met great new people and other has left. Personally, I’ve lived a lot of new experiences with Waynabox and I’ve visited places where I’d stay forever.
It would take a full new post if I wanted to review my past 2018 actually, but I write down this for another reason. 2019 is already here and that’s a fact. I’m not a person who writes down his new year resolutions but this year it’s going to be different and I’m gonna try it (well, we are already at mid January). So here is my 2019 resolutions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write more post about UX research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time I like more and more to analyze and explore the field of UX. How the digital user (or not) interacts with the technology and the world around us. I think it’s a super important aspect in our lives and many times we don’t even stop to think about it. Actually, the field of UX is a very unscientific field, where, at best, A/B testing studies are done to assess whether a proposed solution is better than another to solve a problem based on a behavior made by a number of people but I think there is still much to improve and demonstrate. That’s why this year I’d like to improve Waynabox UX, analyze the changes and publish them here to bring the community a little more knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Travel more&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think it makes this point. Lately, I have traveled a lot in Europe and this year I would like to discover cities and countries outside the continent to see clearer contrasts of culture, gastronomy and traditions. If all goes well, I will achieve it next month traveling to the U.S. and Mexico to work from there (here you have more info of what I’m talking about)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build something for travelers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With each technology that appears, the new flight search engine that is born and new travel APIs a set of tools are generated being able to create new products for people who like to travel in a different way. That’s why this year I want to take advantage of those resources to build something that helps people who spend their lives traveling more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get in shape&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since some year ago I’ve been thinking about getting in shape (in the end, my daily activity until today is reduced to going from home to work, sitting for 8 hours and going from work to home) and I have always postponed (trying to justify it with some absurd excuse). Last November I started to run (I even did 60km a week) and I started to lose weight until a knee injury interrupted my workouts. Now that I’m recovered I’m ready to start running again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all! I think are all reasonable and hopefully, I’ll achieve all of them.
I’ll be posting my progress around here, so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dani</name></author><category term="lifestyle" /><summary type="html">2018 has been an amazing year.

&lt;p&gt;4 years ago I started to dedicate my life, with 2 friends, to build one I idea we had once: make people travel in a different way across Europe. This is how Waynabox started. These 4 years have been awesome; full of emotions, knowing new people and learning more than an after-university grade could teach me, but I’ve been too focused on doing everything works smoothly that I’ve not had time to do what I enjoy the most: &lt;strong&gt;travel&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travel is one of the best things you can do in life. They say travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer. And it’s true. You are buying an experience and, as human behavior is defined by experiences, after all, it defines who you are. There is nothing like seeing other cultures, know how do the people live in the other part of the globe, discover traditions that never could imagine o connect with someone at a glance that you have never seen before. Travel changes your perception about what you have, who you are and what do you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/croatia1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Myself visiting Split, one of the most beautiful cities in Croatia&quot; title=&quot;Myself visiting Split, one of the most beautiful cities in Croatia&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Myself visiting Split, one of the most beautiful cities in Croatia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last November 16 I turned 27, and with the 30s crisis approaching (yeah, you now will say I’m still young and so on) you start asking yourself some things. What I just did achieve? Did I miss something? How much time I have before I take a house loan?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I think it’s a good moment to stop and think about what is what I want and which things are those ones which make me happy. And one of them is travel. Is true I’ve traveled a lot lastly through Europe, but I’ve never known what does it feels like being on vacations more than 2 days in a row and disconnect from your work entirely, something I suppose it’s important to do from time to time. Knowing that Waynabox is still running good -and hopefully it will do in the near future, I think a good solution is to work traveling. Good to me, being developer allows you to work from anywhere where you have internet and coffee to convert into code, so I started to interest in this style of life, and I saw there are a lot of freelancers/developers that do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to left the flat where I live, sell my motorbike and start a digital nomad life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it’s not a lifestyle for everyone, but now I’m not chained to any loan and still single, is a good time to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To not be disconnected entirely from my work team, I’ve decided to do travel cycles, like 2-3 months traveling and one in my birthplace (Barcelona) to don’t lose the contact with my family and friends. This way I’ll still be able to discover the world without and keep time for being with the people I love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-do-i-start-from&quot;&gt;Where do I start from?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same way you usually do an MVP when you are trying to launch an idea, I’m making a pilot journey to Lisbon, where I’ll be working from 2 weeks to establish some protocols, try remote working tools and adapt myself to this new lifestyle. Why Lisbon? Well, is one of my favorite city in Europe. The food is amazing, it’s cheap and I have some friends there. There is no better way to start this adventure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about being a digital nomad is that you are free to go wherever you want and decide where are you going to live your life in your next months it’s not easy. Nomadlist helped me a lot to decide but I’ve always wanted to visit two regions: South America and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As recently new low-cost airlines appeared to do long-haul trips, the price tickets for going to America are really cheap now, so I’ve decided to start from visiting Mexico (I like spicy food and my surname is Mendoza, you know) and also visit some other US cities in the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/route.png&quot; alt=&quot;How my route looks like so far&quot; title=&quot;How my route looks like so far&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;em&gt;How my route looks like so far&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all of those who are thinking about taking this lifestyle or just want to know about how my adventure is going I’ve opened this blog (I hope I can keep updated, I’m not really used to write too much about my life) where I’ll be posting my trips, pictures, experiences, and tips about the places I visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all for now. I’m really excited about to start this adventure. I’m conscious I’ll know a lot of new people, I’ll discover new cultures and I’ll life new unique experiences. But life is about that. Isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
