         <div class="flex flex-col prose lg:prose-lg">
         <p>2018 has been an amazing year. Full of trips, adventures, new emotions and surprising experiences. I‚Äôve met great new people and other has left. Personally, I‚Äôve lived a lot of new experiences with Waynabox and I‚Äôve visited places where I‚Äôd stay forever.
It would take a full new post if I wanted to review my past 2018 actually, but I write down this for another reason. 2019 is already here and that‚Äôs a fact. I‚Äôm not a person who writes down his new year resolutions but this year it‚Äôs going to be different and I‚Äôm gonna try it (well, we are already at mid January). So here is my 2019 resolutions:</p>

<p><strong>Write more post about UX research</strong></p>

<p>Every time I like more and more to analyze and explore the field of UX. How the digital user (or not) interacts with the technology and the world around us. I think it‚Äôs a super important aspect in our lives and many times we don‚Äôt even stop to think about it. Actually, the field of UX is a very unscientific field, where, at best, A/B testing studies are done to assess whether a proposed solution is better than another to solve a problem based on a behavior made by a number of people but I think there is still much to improve and demonstrate. That‚Äôs why this year I‚Äôd like to improve Waynabox UX, analyze the changes and publish them here to bring the community a little more knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Travel more</strong></p>

<p>I don‚Äôt think it makes this point. Lately, I have traveled a lot in Europe and this year I would like to discover cities and countries outside the continent to see clearer contrasts of culture, gastronomy and traditions. If all goes well, I will achieve it next month traveling to the U.S. and Mexico to work from there (here you have more info of what I‚Äôm talking about)</p>

<p><strong>Build something for travelers</strong></p>

<p>With each technology that appears, the new flight search engine that is born and new travel APIs a set of tools are generated being able to create new products for people who like to travel in a different way. That‚Äôs why this year I want to take advantage of those resources to build something that helps people who spend their lives traveling more.</p>

<p><strong>Get in shape</strong></p>

<p>Since some year ago I‚Äôve been thinking about getting in shape (in the end, my daily activity until today is reduced to going from home to work, sitting for 8 hours and going from work to home) and I have always postponed (trying to justify it with some absurd excuse). Last November I started to run (I even did 60km a week) and I started to lose weight until a knee injury interrupted my workouts. Now that I‚Äôm recovered I‚Äôm ready to start running again.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs all! I think are all reasonable and hopefully, I‚Äôll achieve all of them.
I‚Äôll be posting my progress around here, so stay tuned.</p>
